This is a simple react + django + postgre sql react project todolist
To get you can simply clone this repo, change postgresql hosts or db name, run migrate and run some commands on backend directory. Just search on documentation I am feeling lazy to write it out

For frontend you can just npm install and npm run dev

Make sure you run both python and npm simutenously otherwise it will not work!!

anyway enjoy just messsage me if you face issues you can contact me via email: thapasvt12@gmail.com or just send message to my social link it should be available in my profile!!!
